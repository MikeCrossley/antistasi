# Roadmap

## Elevator pitch

## Features

* Players are a band of FIA guerillas who start with almost nothing and fight to take the island from the well-resourced AAF.
* The player side starts with almost nothing and gains resources and capabilities over the course of the game.
* Similarly, the AAF starts with limited capabilites, but gains them over time, but, their capabilities always outstrip the player.
* Both sides are supported by outside major powers, NATO and Russia.
* Victory is achieved when the FIA control the majority of island, plus the main airport.
* Island control is based on support of the population, each city can support FIA or AAF.
* Cities support a side based on an influence score, which reflects the civilians attitude towards the two factions.
* Cities support the side which provides security and economic support.
* Cities can be secured by placing forces and assets in the city, and eliminating enemy assets and forces.
* Cities can be supported economically by providing power, or do missions on behalf of a town.
* There are several types of military installations: outposts, airports, bases, roadblocks, and AA Hills.
* There are several types of economic installations: factories, resources, and seaports.
* Occasionally the players are assigned important, time-sensitive high risk/high reward missions.
* NATO supports the player through training, recon, and material, tied to the level of economic support the player provides to cities.
* Players can go behind enemy lines to hack radio towers, placing a bug which allows them to gain more intel (and missions).

## Guidelines

* Follow ACE style guidelines
* Any change in important scores or resources should be communicated to the player
* All choices should be interesting.
* Behavior should be emergent.
* Because of their extensive resources, the AAF always tends to gain cities over time if the player does nothing.
* Player strategies should change over time.
* Random/auto-assigned missions should be important, high risk and reward.
* Missions are not quests, missions are intel.
* Missions and cities are FIA resource faucets, all military activites and economic city support is a resource sink.
* Russia support should act as an "ambient difficulty" level - 100 is max, 0 is minimum.
* NATO support should feel like god coming down from the sky to help you - it should usually offer you tactical capability beyond your current level.
* Changing the map/factions should be easy. Antistasi-SH Tanoa should be easy to port, basically just throw down some markers in the editor.

## Core systems

* Influence - economic and military
* Installations
* Mission intel (Reworking rewards and building the radio tower mission)
* NATO rework
* Tactical progression - enemy side
* Tactical progression - player side
